# LeoAI PDM Add-in Installation Guide

## Quick Installation

### Step 1: Install the MSI
You can use the pre-built MSI installer or build it yourself. [Prebuilt installers are available for download here.](https://github.com/kimdavis1/leo-ai-sw-addins/blob/main/SwPdmAddin/LeoAISetUp/LeoAISetUp.msi)

1. Run the `LeoAISetUp.msi` file as Administrator.
2. The add-in and all required files will be installed to:
   - `C:\Program Files\LeoAISwPdmAddIn`
3. The installer will automatically register the add-in with your PDM vault(s). No further manual steps are required.

### Step 2: Verification
After installation:
1. Open PDM Administrator and connect to your vault.
2. Navigate to Add-ins in the vault tree. The LeoAI add-in should be visible under your vault's add-ins.
